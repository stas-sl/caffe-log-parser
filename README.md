# caffe-log-parser

### Features ###

- Compare results of multiple experiments in one plot
- Compare test/train outputs in one plot
- Plot concatenated logs (if an experiment was interrupted and then started again, you can just 
concat multiple files into one)
- Optionally averaging values for more smooth graphs if there is much noise
- (TODO) Show/hide traces by stage(test/train), experiment(file) or output name (loss, lr, accuaracy, etc ...)
